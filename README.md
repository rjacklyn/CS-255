Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

> DriverPass offers an improved platform for student drivers to prepare for their theoretical driving exams and arrange appointments for practical driving tests. The company aimed to develop a website enabling users to register, buy study packages, access online study materials and exams, and book practice sessions with drivers. Additionally, DriverPass employees require the capability to purchase packages on behalf of customers and manage their appointment schedules.

What did you do particularly well?
> In my opinion, I believe I understood the needs of the program well and figured out how we could sucessfully intergrade those needs into the program. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
> I think the project I would revise would be Project One. I would add more limitations and assumptions to provide more perspective to the project. It would be helpful to figure out how to deal with those issues or come up with an alternative solution to them if needed down the road. Having those ideas in mind would be important to consider if need be. 

> How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Firstly, I made sure I understood what exactly the user is needing within their project. It is important to be on the same page as the client and make sure that they know what they need, and those needs are expressed to me. It is important to consider the user’s needs as it is the essential foundation for what you are designing. Project aside, you need to ensure tahyt you have all the functions needed within the project to align with what the user needs to have done. If you don’t, the project is considered largely unfinished, in my opinion.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
 > Desinging software involves understanding requirements, setting design goals, considering non-functional requirements, and gaining feedback and knowledge of how your program works in terms of usability. Thinking of it in functional and non-functional requirements helps seperate two different goals with a common end game, and makes designing the project a lot more manageable. It is important to have all of your ducks in a row and ensure each portion of the code and the program is efficent and makes sense along with working smoothly and having all of the aspects that you need.
